    "description": "I'm showing you how to do a \"whole hog\" barbecue without a 6-foot-long barbecue pit, which you probably don't have, and without a whole hog, which you definitely don't have. While you probably could get those things if you really needed to, by using this experimental, mini version, you really don't have to. Serve on buns.",
