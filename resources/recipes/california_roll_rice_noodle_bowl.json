    "description": "We're turning America's favorite sushi roll into a bowl, but instead of sushi rice, we're using rice noodles. Unlike actual California rolls, this cold, refreshing, delicious dish requires no skill or experience. Plus, we can use this exact same method to turn any of our other favorite sushi rolls into a rice noodle bowl.",
